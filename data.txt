// your data file for the character sorter. 
// To use the sorter, make sure this file exists in the same directory as "sorter.html".
// To get started, add characters into the array "var charArray = [ ... ]"
// note that upon first use, the only part that needs to be defined is "var charArray = [ ... ]" 
// You can delete the rest as shown in "array-demo.js"



// after using the sorter and saving your sorter data into this file (remember backups!), you will have a variable:

var numQuestion = 1;	

// the sorter should give you this variable by clicking on "Debug Mode". 
// It defines your match counter. If you want to reset the match counter, remove the line (or forward slash it out).



// below is the place to tell your sorter to delete certain characters from your presortetd data.
// insert the character IDs (the last number in each line defining your character) into this array:

var remove = [  ];

// here is an example how to remove the characters with the IDs 3, 5 and 11 from your array:
// var remove = [ 2, 5, 11 ];



// below is your character array, the only code necessary for the sorter to launch.
// The array defines a character name and image link to a portrait of the character.
// if you already pre-sorted your characters, your will find numbers added to each line. 
// these define the match counter, win counter and a unique character ID. 
// Please do not manually change character IDs, as they are set up in a particular way for the sorter to use.

// below is your match counter. The script will fill in numbers that define matchups that you already decided upon.
// this prevents double matchups and thus helps the sorter to get more quickly through all possibilites.
